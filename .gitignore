# Pods should be ignored when building with CocoaPods, but not when youâ€™re using CocoaPods to manage dependencies.
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control
